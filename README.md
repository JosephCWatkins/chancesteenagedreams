This is a collection of the rare 50's Rock n Roll that I have discovered. I am mainly doing this to have 
my collection in a central place as well as to try to preserve the recordings of this music as best as 
possible; as it is relatively hard to get these recordings here in America (as I think most of these 
songs can be found on various European compilations). 
 That being said these song's copyrights have probably already expired with time, seeing as they are nearly 
 seventy years old at this point with low probability that the majority (if not all) of them will probably 
 not be renewed any time soon. The collection is comprised of compilation albums that I found wherein a lot 
 of the songs make repeat appearances in, however with varying degrees of remastering. 
  The music itself is mainly doo-wop centric pop with an occasional flair of soul and some rockabilly ten- 
  dancies. It should be noted that these songs are rare for a reason: the majority of them could be consi- 
  dered "flops" or amateur in it's talent. There are however hidden gems among these recordings that are 
  absolutely awesome. 
   These recordings have a very nice aesthetic to them in the fact that they harken back to High School 
   days and generate nostalgia in the respects of First Love, Innocence, and the Idylic Nature of Youth: 
   wherein the songs themselves seem to be conspicuous and knowledgeable of the themes thereof (like "To 
   Love And Be Young" by Billy Sha-rae, who apparently went on to record the first ever Funk record albe- 
   it in "To Love And Be Young" he sounds almost British and proper to think such "soulfulness" could come 
   out of him lol). These themes are what enflame my heart for this music as it's a still picture of Youth 
   and First Love, wherein I never got to experience in High School and therefore can live out through this 
   music. 
    The first time I came across these songs was in the "Rare Rock N' Roll Tracks Of The '50s & '60s" com- 
    pilation albums (wherein at least one thereof is available on Apple Music) when I bought the songs "Sandy", 
    "Dream Angel", and "Teenage Dreams" by the Webtones. I liked these three songs because it had nice aesthetic 
    and had a nice generic doo-wop sound which I Love so much. It was only later that I came back to the full alb- 
    um. I initially did not like most of the album due to it's amateur talent but it eventually grew on me. I must 
    note that the reason I think this particular album of the series was on Apple Music is beacuse it had no problem 
    going past copyright when the company compiled the album due to it was probably the poorest album of the series 
    that I have yet heard. 
     I then went on to buy at least two more of the albums: namely Volumes 1 and 3, which in my humble opinion 
     are much better recordings than the only one that was available on Apple Music (and also harder to find. I had 
     yet to find the rest of these compilation albums due to the fact I think they are European in nature and all 
     other albums of this compilation are only available in other countries (believe me, I have tried to access them 
     to buy them). However, I finally came across the compilation albums of "Let's Go Steady" which are again EXTRE- 
     MELY hard to find, but I have found them in certain places wherein I had to snatch them up. Let's Go Steady pretty 
     much contains every single song I had found in my initial album compilation series as well as a bunch more. The only 
     drawback to the "Let's Go Steady" album compilation is that the songs are relatively less remastered than the initial 
     compilation that I found (listening to them side-by-side would make this evident) however it by no means disrupts the 
     enjoyment of the songs and even is probably the original recording sound of the record itself. In fact when I discovered 
     the "Let's Go Steady" compilation I believed my initial compilation set I found was just these songs taken and remastered 
     a little. 
      I wish to preserve this music and I wish this aesthetic would become popular again. I even believe that recently the song 
      "Where's The Girl For Me" by Pete Schrayder became viral on TikTok because I saw comments pertaining to it on the YouTube 
      video of the song. There are also a handful of YouTube channels that have collected these records for years and posted them 
      online to the extent that their audio recordings of the songs might be the only in existence at the moment. I intend to go 
      through their channels and take their entire libraries to add to this repository (with due respect and credit of course) 
      because I would not like the idea at all of their channels getting taken down with all the music with them. This is one of 
      the many reasons I am taking the initiative to put as many of these songs in this repository as possible and perhaps have 
      some others contribute at some point (although that is wishful thinking considering how obscure my musical tastes seem to be). 
       Anyways, God Bless and keep the music alive :).
